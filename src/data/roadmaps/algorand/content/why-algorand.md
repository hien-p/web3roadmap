# Why build on Algorand? 
Many blockchain platforms exist today, but blockchain is not widely used yet. Because the technology could not provide decentralization, security, and scalability at the same timeâ€”until now.


Algorand offers 
* high performance with 10,000 TPS
* <3 second block latency
* Immediate transaction finality due to its non-forking blockchain. 

It provides comprehensive developer tools, including support for smart contracts in Python and SDKs in Python, JavaScript, Golang, and Java.
