# Three types of storage

Algorand Smart Contracts (ASC1) have three types of storage: local storage, global storage, and box storage.

* Local storage is for each account using the smart contract. It keeps data related to that account's use of the contract.

* Global storage is for the whole smart contract application. It keeps data shared by all accounts using the contract.

* Boxes are storage parts that can hold up to 32kb of data. They are used for bigger or more detailed information.

Both global and local storage are structured as Key/Value pairs. Each Key/Value pair in storage has a limit of 128 bytes.
