# Algorand Smart Contracts (ASC1)
Algorand Smart Contracts (ASC1) are small programs that perform different tasks on the blockchain and are executed directly on the Algorand network.

There are two main types of smart contracts:
* Smart contract(Stateful contracts): can be called and interacted with from any node on the Algorand blockchain

* Smart signatures(Stateless contracts): used for transaction signing purposes, particularly for signature delegation
