# What is Modules 
Modules are libraries that define struct types along with functions that operate on these type

A module has the following syntax:
```
module <address>::<identifier> {
    (<use> | <friend> | <type> | <function> | <constant>)*
}
```

where address is a [valid literal address](https://move-language.github.io/move/address.html)
