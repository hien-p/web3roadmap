# Key Features of MoveVM

* Resource-Oriented Programming:

MoveVM introduces a novel approach where assets are treated as tangible, non-duplicable resources, ensuring a higher degree of security and integrity in asset management.

* Strong Safety Guarantees

By employing a bytecode verification process, MoveVM ensures that all executing code adheres to stringent security protocols, minimizing vulnerabilities and enhancing the overall robustness of the blockchain system.

* Efficient Asset Management:

It provides a controlled environment that allows for precise management of digital assets, ensuring transactions are executed with utmost fidelity and reliability.

* Type Safety and Formal Verification

MoveVM emphasizes type safety, employing a rigorous type system that catches errors at compile-time. Coupled with formal verification methods, it ensures that smart contracts adhere to specified properties and security standards, reducing the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities.

* Isolation and Encapsulation

Assets and code in MoveVM are encapsulated in modules, enforcing strict access controls and isolation. This encapsulation prevents unauthorized access and interaction, ensuring that each module operates within its defined parameters, thereby enhancing the overall security and integrity of the system.

* Bytecode Verification:

MoveVM employs a comprehensive bytecode verification process to scrutinize smart contracts before execution. This step ensures that all contracts meet the platformâ€™s safety and correctness criteria, significantly mitigating the risk of executing malicious or flawed code.
