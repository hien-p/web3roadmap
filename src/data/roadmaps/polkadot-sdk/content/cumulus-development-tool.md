## Zombienet

Zombienet aims to serve as a testing framework for Substrate-based blockchains. It offers a straightforward CLI tool for spawning and testing ephemeral networks. Tests can include assertions on on-chain storage, metrics, logs, and custom JavaScript scripts that interact with the chain.
