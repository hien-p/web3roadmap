# What is Substrate?

- Substrate (PolkadotSDK) is an SDK using Rust libraries to help build custom blockchains with modular components. Substrate provides default blockchain infrastructure components, allowing developers to focus on application logic


## There are two directions for chain development
- These blockchains can operate independently (Standalone Chain/ Permissionless Chain)
- Benefiting from Polkadot's shared security( Parachain)
