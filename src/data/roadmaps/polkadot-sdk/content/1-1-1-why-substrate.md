# Why Substrate?


1. **Modular and Flexible Framework**: 
Substrate is a highly modular and flexible framework that lets you build a blockchain by selecting and customizing the infrastructure components that best fit your project.

2. **Upgradable State Transition Logic**: 
- Substrate is designed to be upgradeable. The state transition logic, known as the Substrate runtime, is a self-contained WebAssembly object.
- You can change this runtime completely whenever you need to introduce new features or update existing ones.

3. **OpenSource and Community**:
- Substrate is an open-source project, with all libraries and tools available under open-source licensing.
- Substrate also has a large, active, and supportive builder community contributing to the ecosystem.

4. **Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM)**:
Substrate supports cross-consensus messaging (XCM), allowing different systems to communicate with each other.
